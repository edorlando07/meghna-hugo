For me, the learning journey is never complete.  I continue to sharpen my data science skills by regularly tuning into Matt Dancho's Business Science University (BSU). BSU offers advanced Learning Labs that discuss advanced data science topics. My formal education includes a Masters in Analytics and Modeling from Valparaiso University, an MBA from Purdue NW, and a Bachelors in Finance and Accounting from Purdue NW.

I am also a Certified Analytics Professional and certified as a Tableau Qualified Associate.
