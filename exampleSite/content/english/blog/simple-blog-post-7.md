I have over 8 years of experience maintaining and developing White Lodging's data value chain.  As a Data Scientist, I have published numerous applications, dashboards, and data science studies utilized by 80+ hotels, corporate senior leaders and executives.  

As a Limited Term Lecturer at Purdue University NW, I teach Applied Statistics and Data Visualization best practices.  

I also regularly sharpen my skills by tuning into Business Science University's Learning Labs which discusses advanced R topics and methods.
